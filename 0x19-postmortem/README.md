Title: Navigating a Web Stack Outage - A Lesson in Resilience
Issue Summary:
Duration: January 26, 2024, 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: My primary web service experienced a 30% degradation, affecting my user experience with slow response times and intermittent errors.
Timeline:
Detection Time: January 26, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
Detection Method: Monitoring alerts signaled increased error rates, prompting my immediate attention.
Actions Taken:
10:05 AM: Initiated investigation into my server logs and network traffic.
10:30 AM: Initially assumed a database overload, focusing on my database-related investigations.
11:15 AM: Collaborated with my database team; expanded investigation to the application layer.
12:00 PM: Realized the misdirection; escalated the incident to senior developers and administrators.
Misleading Paths:
Early focus on my database issues and suspicions of a DDoS attack proved distracting, delaying the identification of the actual problem.
Escalation:
Escalated to senior developers and administrators at 12:30 PM when the root cause wasn’t immediately apparent.
Resolution:
Root Cause: Misconfiguration in my load balancer settings, causing uneven traffic distribution.
Resolution: Corrected my load balancer settings and conducted a thorough review; my service was restored by 2:00 PM.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Enhanced monitoring for my load balancer issues.
Automated alerts for traffic distribution deviations.
Scheduled regular load testing to ensure scalability.
Tasks:
Patched my load balancer software.
Comprehensive review of all my load balancing configurations.
Conducted training sessions for my operations team on load balancer troubleshooting.







2. Title: “The Day Our Code Went on a Coffee Break” - A Web Stack Outage Odyssey
Introduction: Hello there, fellow techies! Today, I’m not just serving you your regular post-mortem; I’m offering you a front-row seat to the epic saga of the day our code decided to take an impromptu coffee break. Yes, you read that right – our code has a caffeine addiction! ☕
Issue Summary:
Duration: January 26, 2024, 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: Our web service took a siesta, causing a 30% slowdown in user experience. It seems even codes need their midday nap.
Timeline:
Detection Time: January 26, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
Detection Method: Our monitoring alerts screamed louder than a toddler in a candy store, catching my attention faster than a fresh cup of espresso.
Visual Aid: !Code searching for coffee
Actions Taken:
10:05 AM: Started digging into server logs like a detective hunting for clues, because, you know, our code had a sudden urge for caffeine.
10:30 AM: Initially thought our database was on strike due to overworking, but turns out, it was just on a coffee break too. ☕
11:15 AM: Pulled in the database team, who were as surprised as I was that databases could have coffee breaks.
12:00 PM: Realized we were barking up the wrong tree, or should I say, brewing the wrong coffee. Expanded the investigation to the application layer.
Misleading Paths:
Initially assumed our code was on a caffeine-fueled rampage, leading us to blame the innocent database for the coffee shortage.
Escalation:
At 12:30 PM, the incident was escalated to the senior devs and administrators, who joined the quest for the missing coffee beans.
Resolution:
Root Cause: Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven traffic distribution.
Resolution: Corrected load balancer settings and conducted a thorough review; service restored by 2:00 PM.
